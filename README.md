# Hi, I’m Todd Pratt — DevOps & Web Software Engineer

I build reliable, observable platforms with IaC, containers, and CI/CD.  
**Toolbox:** Linux, Ansible, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes (K3s/AKS), Helm, NGINX/Traefik, Prometheus/Grafana, Loki/Promtail, Jenkins/GitHub Actions, SQL.

## Highlights
- Designed end-to-end CI/CD with versioned Docker images and integration tests in Compose/K8s.
- Production-grade observability stack (Prometheus + Grafana + Loki/Promtail) with actionable alerts.
- Secure by default: TLS everywhere (ACME/step-ca), least-privilege, secrets hygiene.

## How I work
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Ansible), GitOps where it fits (Argo CD/Flux).
- Automated tests (unit + integration), security scanning in CI.
- Clear READMEs: what it is, how to run it locally, how it’s deployed.
